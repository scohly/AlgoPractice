# AlgoPractice
Here is where I practice algorithm development for possible future interviews / also to get them brain juices flowing!

Most of the code is in Java but I am also keeping concurrent with c++ and tend to also code algorithims in that as well. 

Also VisualCode makes life...kind of easy
